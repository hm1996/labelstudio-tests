25051,29026,0,"Whether or not you like this movie will probably depend on whether you like seeing movies where the leading characters aren't particularly bright or likable. If you can get past this, you'll probably be a person who would rate this movie higher than a 2.<br /><br />Kristen seems like a normal and decent sort of person for the first 1/4 of the film. In fact, at times, she physically looks a lot like the director, Liv Ullmann. However, rather inexplicably, she is swept away by a rogue. WHY she loves him exactly is never clear--it just seems like a case of infatuation. BUT, here's where the dumb part of the film occurs. First, despite there being little to base such a strong attraction on, Kirsten sleeps with the man and pledges her life to him--even after she finds out he already has a mistress (who, left her own husband to be with him). Then, despite finding out more and more and more awful things about the guy (he's a real pig), she steadfastly refuses to back away from him---hurting her parents and her fiancé in the process. Think about it--a woman sacrifices everything for a man she barely knows and what so does know about him is really bad stuff!! I hate films about dumb people.<br /><br />By the way, IF the film had been the same up until she met the jerk and then fell in love with a WORTHY man, then this could have been a wonderful film about a young lady choosing an arranged marriage or listening to her own needs. But, as she is just a horny idiot, this was an opportunity lost.",Train,./train/unsup/29026_0.txt,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113576/usercomments
25052,14540,0,"I recently watched this movie for the first time in a long time and I soon realized why I've avoided it for so long. First of all, I have to say that I've always loved the ""Peanuts"" comic strip and the delightfully witty antics of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus and Lucy. ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is still my all time favorite Xmas special and most of the early specials remain among my favorites. And I saw ""A Boy named Charlie Brown"" at the theatre as a kid and still love it. I never saw ""Snoopy Come Home"" at the theatre,probably because I felt that I was getting too old for the Peanuts gang. But I did catch the movie when it appeared on network TV a few years later. I remember being so disappointed I didn't even watch to the end. So when I decided to take another look at it, I thought maybe I misjudged it. Unfortunately, I realized that I had not misjudged it. First of all, this is the first ""Peanuts"" production that didn't have Charlie Brown in the title. Also, Vince Guaraldi, the wonderfully talented composer of the specials is not involved at all. Then there is a very dark and very sad plot line, involving Snoopy leaving Charlie and the gang to visit his original owner,Leila in the hospital. I know this was a story line from the strip, but in the strip, Charlie Brown and the others don't seem to come off as badly as they do in this film. And lets face it, the music is corny as all get out. Guaraldis music is sorely missed here. His scores are filled with joy and optimism, but the music here is so manipulative and dated, you don't feel joy, but you feel used. The one part I really enjoyed was when Snoopy is captured by the crazy Clara. That was the only time I felt any sense of the joy of the classic ""Peanuts"" specials, although I did get kind of a kick out of Thurl Ravenscroft singing ""No Dogs Allowed"" whenever Snoopy saw a sign with that on it. The story had none of the wit of the strip, the specials or the first movie. It just seemed like a bummer every time Charlie Brown came on, bemoaning the loss of his dog. And even the animation didn't seem as bold or striking as it was in the first movie, with fewer bold choices like the ""Beethoven"" montage from that movie. I've always thought that Snoopy had pretty much taken over the strip in the mid 70s and to an extent, the specials, but the Snoopy obsession seems to have reached its peak here. But I do like the way Peppermint Patty is used here, as well as Woodstock, but thats about it for the positives. Im guessing that the later movies are probably even weaker, because the later specials would suffer, especially following Guaraldis death. You probably think Im just getting old, but I still love the early specials and the first movie and I still love reading classic strips. So I will return to those and get the bad taste of ""Snoopy Come Home"" out of my mouth.",Train,./train/unsup/14540_0.txt,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069289/usercomments

25054,21776,0,"This movie is really a stinker. Everything is good about it except the characters and the writing. It has high production values, the acting is very good, but the characters are shallow, narcissistic and nothing more than sum of their hangups. It's like some teenage film school freshman was given unlimited resources to try to create the most quirky characters ever, without a story to hang it on. Perhaps it's how a spoiled, rich teenager would imagine adults to be, selfish, whiny, demanding and spiritually hollow. <br /><br />The three brothers are riding a train in India in hopes of finding and visiting their mother who failed to show up at their father's funeral. We are treated to a relentless display of the brothers' bizarre and exhibitionistic behavior as the train trundles through the Indian countryside. They behave like chronically depressed 4 year olds. Maybe the filmmaker thought he was getting at contemporary angst, maybe he just thought he was creating amusing madcap clowns in the spirit of ""A Hard Day's Night."" But these clowns aren't young, their antics don't amuse, they grate. We come to hate them as much as they hate each other. We don't care whether they find their mother or not. The older brother's head is always swathed in bandages, the result of a motorcycle crash which may have been an attempted suicide. He orders the other brothers around and they seem unable to stand up to him. One brother reads a couple of paragraphs from a story he's writing. The story is as shallow and pretentious as this movie and these characters. <br /><br />Here's the spoiler: they do meet up with the mother (Angelica Houston) who's the biggest narcissist of all. Dressed in white robes and made up with black eyeliner, she holds forth in some sort of Christian mission in the foothills of the Himalayas. Well, you might have known it...these losers were nurtured by this pompous and vain woman. No wonder. In the end the brothers are running to catch the train to go home, as they run they drop their baggage. That's symbolism; get it? They're shedding their baggage, right? But these characters are so light you can't imagine them having any hardly weight at all, even with their baggage. Without the theatrically contrived baggage they wouldn't have any material existence whatsoever. <br /><br />For the last hour of this film every scene looked like it was going to be the last. The camera focuses on the bewildered faces of the brothers, the music swells, the camera pulls away. At last! you think. It's finally over. But no, there's another scene, and another, and another. At one point they witness a young boy drowning in a canal. They try to rescue him, but can't. They take his body home to his village. There is a funeral. The scene is empty; it's like it happens in dream. The brothers appear unaffected. It is impossible to care about them. I've almost forgotten about this movie and I only saw it 2 days ago.

25055,18725,0,"... but that's an ironic '9'... seriously, if you've ever been bored by a bad Conan rip-off or atrociously dubbed euro-trash, this is the PERFECT movie for you... it's a sci-fi/sword and sandal/post-apocalyptic mish-mash that gets more unbelievable as it goes along. The only way to distill the perfect essence that is Yor is with a meager, unworthy list (scorn) of the more jaw dropping aspects of this classic, underrated treatise on the human condition:<br /><br />1. The theme song, which at one point explains ""Yor's world/He's the maaaaaaaaaaaan(very high castrato soprano)"". <br /><br />2. The horde of smurfs-on-steroids that attack and destroy a very ineptly guarded village of hobos in furs... I'm sorry, ""natives"" in furs. <br /><br />3. Cave bimbo Kalaa's constant assertion that ""Yor's not like other men"" when in fact he looks just like every other South Beach surfer dude who's ever gotten lost in a desert wasteland. <br /><br />4. The viewer's slow realization that fat, greasy comic relief Pak always and consistently pulls Yor's fat out of the fryer whenever the blonde barbarian putz is about to get killed. <br /><br />5. Not one, but TWO paper mache dinosaurs. And a giant bat. That becomes an improvised hang glider. No joke. <br /><br />6. Geez, they just keep coming...how 'bout the line ""Take me with you stranger!"" spoken in all earnestness by a non-acting girl-child. <br /><br />7. The straw boat that's supposed to represent a sea-based culture's highest technical achievement... with seating for four. <br /><br />8. Best line in the movie- ""Damn talking box!"" <br /><br />9. Just when you're praying it won't get any more surreal, just when you've thrown up your hands and surrendered your sanity, Darth Vader shows up. Correction: an ARMY of Darth Vaders. <br /><br />10. John Steiner! Remember him? I don't! But he's the 'Overlord'! And by now, it makes sense! <br /><br />11. The same South African factory-basement set from MST3k's ""Space Mutiny"". Now you know the movie has to be a quality effort. <br /><br />12. Laser battle! Yor, having never seen a pulse rifle before, proceeds to pick off half a dozen Vaderbots from a hundred yards... or a coupla feet. My bad. <br /><br />13. Skipping intermediate plot, just know that there's a wise old blind man with a monologue and a candy-stripe barber's pole jutting from the Overlord's gut, along with genetic engineering and nuclear holocaust and a house of mirrors and a rocket jet escape and OH MY GOD they coulda made a sequel! But we all know sequels are never as good as the originals. Plus the theme song runs over the end credits and Pak displays his gymnast skills during the stirring climax... saving Yor yet again! Whatever you come away from this list with, just remember that what you have in your head is not a suitable prep for the untethered insanity, the pure unadulterated madness, the sheer brain scrambling head trip that is...

Their biggest problem is a cow occasionally running in the street. Suddenly, they find out the police station is gonna shut down since there are no criminals around.

As if this were not bad enough, the dialogue is insufferable. The lines are both poorly written AND poorly delivered. The story is narrated by two cheetahs who at least attempt to sound African, but all other roles are done in various accents - none of them consistent or ethnic. The overall result is campy at best.

Instead we get a video nasty plot with the above idea as a (badly done) framing device. In fact I think the main character in this is autobiographical of the director himself (Think about it) and his ambition to make a horror film.

She is a determined woman, one who turned a wrecked life and an enormous family debt into a reason to teach generations of New England young people the virtues of going-through-the-pain to get the gain. The theme of this film is the positive effect of her rough-hewn self-assertiveness training on her students. Jennifer Jones plays the schoolteacher, from youth to old-age, and very winningly. The film was directed by veteran Henry Koster. Others in the very large and amiably charming cast include Robert Stack, fine actor Robert Douglas, Kipp Hamilton, charismatic Peggy Knudsen, Chuck Connors, Jerry Paris, Mary Wickes, Leslie Bradley, Marshall Thompson, Biff Elliott, Richard Deacon and many more. What happens in the story is that Miss Dove falls ill one day during class and has to be carried from her students and taken to the hospital. The town's generations, all taught by this remarkable woman, react; some come from far away or start stopping by the hospital for news; and this leads to a flashback of how her life's course was changed by her father's money problems and the desertion of her by her erstwhile suitor; how she then vowed to pay back every cent of her father's debt, though she was not personally responsible; and how she began teaching school and has gone on doing so. This intelligent, heart-warming and thought-provoking story has a climax in her medical crisis and a happy ending; it is not perhaps a great film, but Miss Dove is very probably a great character, and one many can learn from long after the film has ended. Every element here is well-crafted and contributes to a surprisingly entertaining and most-believable presentation.

Arkin claims he is impotent because of the tyranny of his father and the fact that he is the hated high school basketball coach whose team can't even win one game. Ceasar plays a wacky WWII patient at the the VA hospital who still believes that the war is still ongoing.<br /><br />On a road trip to Florida, Gardenia secretly sets into motion a scheme to burn his Dept. store down and collect the Fire Insurance. Arkin and Reiner think that his parents' absence presents the perfect opportunity to prove their father wrong and refurbish and restock the store and make a success of it. They don't know of the plot and go to work. Ceasar as Gardenia's unwitting foil is priceless. The pace of the film accelerates and is replete with a few clever twists.

Losing one eye and temporarily paralyzed from the waist down, Richard vows his vengeance and vents his frustration while searching for his wife by killing strippers in inventive ways. He sends one a rose with thorns dipped in poison, shoots a poison dart into the stomach of another, and by the finale, a dagger, a buzzsaw, and a crossbow fit into the whole mess.<br /><br />TOUCH OF HER FLESH is really sick. First the audience is treated to coy sex scenes and stripping/go-go scenes, followed immediately by scenes of death and gore. I guess that's why they call them sickies. All the acting is bad, but most of the women would fit right in a Russ Meyer film! Top-heavy tarts make up most of the nudity here, which is pleasing to the eye and sort of differentiates this from other films of its kind. There are some good instances of cinematography and editing that are above par in an exploitation film as well.<br /><br />TOUCH OF HER FLESH is not for everyone and will probably offend those looking for a softcore sex film from the 60s. The version I saw was cut, as the film only ran an hour (original running time is 70 minutes), but the sex was not graphic; it's the gore that should draw audiences. Sadistic viewers should enjoy it, but I'm surprised cries of misogyny haven't plagued this film from its release! Not heartily recommended, but is worth a look if you're curious.

In a recent string of events he has managed to pull himself on film with a few ""halfway decent"" titles, but 88 Minutes is the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />This has to be one of the most fake movies I've seen in recent years. I can accept movies like Lord of the Rings and Spiderman because they aren't actually supposed to take place in real-time. This whole flick takes itself too seriously, and the ridiculous car chases and explosions make it to show that this couldn't possibly happen in real life. Whoever wrote this needs to go back to school and learn some real engaging material, something that is more real and sophisticated. It's just very unreal.<br /><br />The scripting was just awful. Terrible one-liners, and the supporting actors all act as if they were on steroids and running rampant as the movie wears on. The female actresses couldn't act to save their lives. And boy, did you ever notice how similar this was compared to other thriller type movies in this era? I mean cm-on it's as if people can't think of something original anymore.

I thought it couldn't get any worse than Highlander: Endgame, but I was very much mistaken. This is just a terrible movie - like watching a train wreck.<br /><br />If they didn't destroy continuity in every movie and rewrite the history of the Highlander universe, it might be bearable. Like every other Highlander movie, this one acts like nothing came before it and nothing about it makes sense - it's an insult to the intelligence of the fans. And we have to suffer through yet another half-witted attempt to re-invent the source of immortality and what happens if ""there can be only one."" The post-apocalyptic world is just plain dark and dreary. Endgame was sort of heading in that direction - it was significantly more world-weary and tattered than the world of the series. However, The Source just plain doesn't make sense. For the world to have gotten in this condition, more than a few years would have to have passed, and Joe Dawson should look more than a couple of years older - by rights the character should have been dead before this movie takes place. But hey, I guess they figure we can't add either.<br /><br />The fight scenes are terrible - the speeded-up special effects destroy the fun of the fight scenes, and you always expect one decent sword-fighting scene in a Highlander movie - not this one! If I had realized how bad this was going to be, I could have resigned myself to ogling Methos for a couple of hours. This movie is so bad even *that* isn't enjoyable. If I had seen this in a movie theater I'd have wanted my money back. As it is, I want back the time I wasted watching this dreck.<br /><br />I'm giving up Highlander movies for good.

Directed and written by Juzo Itami, ""A Taxing Woman"" stars his wife, Nobuko Miyamoto, as the tax collector and Tsutomu Yamazaki as the tax-evading criminal.<br /><br />It's a fascinating glimpse into Japanese culture in 1987, when the picture was made. Yamazaki plays the owner of a chain of love hotels, and he hides his income. Miymato plays a recently-promoted tax auditor, and she is given the job of ferreting out his hidden income so that the proper tax is collected. The cat and mouse game begins.<br /><br />The opposing actors have a real chemistry between them, and their blossoming love comes as no surprise. Since the plot involves love hotels, we get some nudity, and because the cops and crooks are involved, there's a chase scene, too. Miyamoto is shown as a tired woman with bags under her eyes, but she's an attractive and worthy opponent to our tax cheat. That the crook is a complex man capable of - and worthy of - love takes the movie out of the ordinary comedy genre.<br /><br />If you like this comedy, there's an even lighter farce with the two lead actors you might enjoy: ""Tampopo,"" which preceded ""A Taxing Woman."" ""Tampopo"" involves setting up the perfect raman restaurant, with chefs closely guarding their noodle recipes and other such nonsense. An amusing movie with food eroticism.<br /><br />""A Taxing Woman"" was so popular, they did a sequel, but I liked the original so much I didn't see the sequel.",Train,./train/unsup/3640_0.txt,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093502/usercomments

All of this is set against the backdrop of the suffering endured by Allied soldiers in a jungle prison camp during World War II. The filmmakers provide a fascinating contrast between Eastern and Western cultural values, as well as between Christianity and the Japanese Bushido code of behavior. The movie shows clearly and refreshingly that the worldview of a people does influence its behavior, and that it is possible to judge one worldview as superior to another. It also shows that when human beings act selfishly, they lose hope and end up destroying one another. But when we act with sacrificial love toward each other, not only do we stand a better chance of living, we also keep from becoming savages. What a wonderful, thoughtful film!

I thoroughly enjoyed Clarence Brown's depiction of this lost innocent era, which produced a warm glow within me as I watched.

Citizenry is represented here by the excellent female star Michèle Morgan, the military equally well by actor Gérard Philipe. The magnificent interaction between the two of them makes this movie going: Morgan, playing a divorced Parisienne running a ladies' fashion shop, has herself seduced at last by officer Philipe's tireless efforts. But at that very moment their relationship takes a turn for the worse.<br /><br />Their tragedy gets more dimension, and is softened at the same time by the succesful development of another love.

Elfen Lied has nothing to fear now, it still probably can top this. Okay seriously I am very disappointed in this series, considering I wanted a good suspense thriller that wasn't based purely on 100% excess and shock-factoring.<br /><br />Higurashi is a story of several different arcs. Each arc is a different version of the same story. In 1983 a young male transfer student comes to a small town. A town with a deadly secret. Apparently after a traditional summer festival one person will be killed and another will disappear. The story repeats in the same fashion through each arc usually ending in a brutal murder or murders of some one or some people, but something.<br /><br />As wonderful as the plot sounds it really isn't. The series had immense potential to create a suspenseful masterpiece, but instead it's like watching a filler arc when something finally happens after 6 episodes. Each episode is as long winded and wordy as the next, until something may just happen only for it to be a classic and clichéd horror blunder trick. Oh but don't get me wrong, eventually something does happen, but when it FINALLY does it provides maybe a few minutes of fright but that's it. So yes this series seriously lack suspense, half the time you feel more like you are watching a slice-of-life comedy instead of a thriller.<br /><br />Until some annoying detective constantly shows up to go over the SAME mystery we heard 5 episodes ago! The series can work up it's suspense and chill level, but fails to keep it long enough for us to get remotely interested. The whole time you are just questioning should I fast-forward or not? Sure I like a talky as much as the next guy maybe even more than the next guy, but excessive dialog simply doesn't usually work well in a thriller. The series tries to build and build but the suspense just keeps falling down again. But there are a few eerie moments, (key word being few) such as the wonderful psychotic laughter from the tiny little ones. (see: http://tinyurl.com/2w5tll) and when it finally does get to the horrifying climax it can give you a few chills, before it abruptly cuts off. Other than that, the series heavily relies on it's dialog and music to give any sense of a creepy atmosphere. And that is all it has going for it.<br /><br />I can't express how dull of a horror this really was.

I saw the movie in German so i don't really know what he said in English, but ironic stuff like ""Yeah right, it doesn't hurt..""?...what is this? Telling yourself ""think about something else"" and then forgetting your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend is just...stupid. And his mother...how the hell does she figure something like that out? Someone comes to tell her, her son died in surgery (what she kind of had to expect). Plus she found some letters in Jessica Albas bag. plus that ""she knows the hospital"" stuff... and then it takes her ""one second"" to figure it out? What the hell?^^ And the ending...why does the police bust them? The patient died in surgery, thats all that happened. That drunk doctor doesn't know anything else either...and then they bust them all, even the girlfriend??? Why??? Despite all that i think Christensen did a bad job, but that doesn't really count for me...those mistakes and stupid things i wrote about above are the problem. I watched this movie with some friends and we all were VERY disappointed... As i said, one of the worst movies i have ever seen... Just don't watch it ;)",Train,./train/unsup/36242_0.txt,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211933/usercomments
25098,33218,0,"First of all, I'm not a Pokemon fan. I rented this movie one day because I was frightfully bored. Now, the movie itself was not ALL THAT BAD. Sure, the dialogue sucks, the characters suck and you could care less if Ash suddenly blows up, but the movie did have a few redeeming qualities. <br /><br /> The animated short, Pikachu's Vacation was not one of them. The short was nearly UNBEARABLE, as it was all in Pokemon Jive Talk. It was so excruciating I nearly fast forwarded to the movie. Now the movie itself was ALMOST average. I didn't care for any character except maybe Mewtwo, who was the only one somewhat developed. The movie does have a good message, but they almost state it directly. The final battle was almost exciting, but other than that, this movie is for the Pokemon fans. 3/10",Train,./train/unsup/33218_0.txt,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190641/usercomments
25099,17110,0,"This film was a BIG mistake. After the first 2 movies, the fans of ""The Crow"" saga made enough money to put this and the second terrible sequel together. This movie has nothing to do with the originally, brilliant cult movie with Brandon Lee. The story and the actors are so boring and useless that I had to laugh when I saw this crap. The makers they put this together are blind? I don't know who is this director phenomena, but I think he never saw anything about James O Barrs' comic or the first movie. The actor with the name Eric Mobius and his story with the burning scars on his face as a mask are so-so silly. Just try it once, you'll see...",Train,./train/unsup/17110_0.txt,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132910/usercomments
